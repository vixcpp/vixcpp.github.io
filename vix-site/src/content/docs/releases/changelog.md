- Middleware & P2P HTTP: routing, session, pipeline, and security modules.
- Validation header-only improvements: schemas, rules, and error handling.

### Changed
- CLI `Ui.hpp` improved tip display formatting.
- Core printing and reflection system refined for runtime debugging.
- JSON module: release v1.10.0 with registry integration.
- Minor API adjustments in ORM, sync, utils, and net modules.
- Bug fixes and header/source consistency across modules.

### Fixed
- Registry publish errors: local registry tips added when `pull --ff-only` fails.
- WebRPC and validation publishing conflicts resolved.
- Various module header/source mismatches corrected.

### Notes
- Version 1.43.0 consolidates registry, package management, and module release workflow.
- All modules now include a `vix.json` for Vix package system integration.
- Developers should run `vix registry sync` before publishing new versions to avoid pull conflicts.

## v1.42.0

### Core

**New universal printing system**

Added a powerful type-aware printing engine inspired by Python's `print()`.

The new `vix::print` module can render most common C++ types automatically:

- STL containers (`vector`, `map`, `set`, etc.)
- tuples and pairs
- `std::optional`
- `std::variant`
- smart pointers
- chrono types
- filesystem paths
- nested structures

Example:

```cpp
#include <vix/print.hpp>

vix::print(42, "hello", std::vector{1,2,3});
```

Additional utilities:

- `vix::pprint()` – multi-line pretty printing
- `vix::sprint()` – format values to string
- `vix::print_each()` – iterate and display ranges
- `vix::print_table()` – map-style table display
- `vix::print_stats()` – numeric container statistics
- `vix::print_diff()` / `vix::print_check()` – debugging helpers

The system is extensible via:

- `operator<<`
- ADL `vix_format(...)`
- `vix::formatter<T>` specialization

### Examples

Added new printing examples:

```
examples/print/
```

## v1.41.0

### CLI

**Improved interactive navigation**

Interactive menus now support both arrow keys and Vim-style navigation.

| Action | Keys |
|------|------|
| Up | `↑` or `k` |
| Down | `↓` or `j` |
| Confirm | `Enter` or `l` |
| Cancel | `Esc`, `h`, `q` |
| Toggle | `Space` |
| Toggle all | `a` |

This improves usability on compact keyboards and Vim-style workflows.

## v1.40.0

### CLI

- feat(cli): support `vix new .` (in-place project scaffold)

  You can now scaffold a Vix project directly in the current directory:

  ```bash
  vix new .
  ```

  If the directory is not empty, Vix prompts before overwriting template files.

- feat(cli): support npm-style scoped packages (`@namespace/name`)

  Vix now supports scoped package names similar to npm:

  ```bash
  vix add @vix/http
  vix add @gaspardkirira/api_app
  ```

  This enables clearer ecosystem organization and registry namespaces.
# [v1.39.0]

## CLI

### Self-healing vix tests

`vix tests` now automatically configures and builds the project when CTest is not ready.

---

### Changes

- Automatically runs `vix check --tests` if the build directory does not exist
- Automatically builds when `CTestTestfile.cmake` is missing
- Re-resolves the preset build directory after auto-build
- Preserves the selected preset to avoid mismatched build directories

---

### Impact

- `vix tests` works on fresh clones without requiring a manual `vix check`
- Removes unnecessary friction in the test workflow
- Improves overall CLI robustness

# [v1.38.0]

Vix now supports automatic version resolution when adding packages.
## You can run:

```bash
vix add namespace/name
```
and Vix will resolve the latest version automatically.
This release also improves transitive dependency installation and ensures vix.lock correctly pins the resolved commit for deterministic builds.

# [v1.37.0] 🚀 New: `--auto-deps` for single-file C++ (script mode)

You can now use libraries installed from the Vix registry directly inside a single `.cpp` file:

```bash
vix run server.cpp --auto-deps
```

- Automatically detects installed dependencies in `.vix/deps`
- Injects the correct `-I` include paths
- Avoids duplicate include flags
- No `CMakeLists.txt` required

---

# 🔼 New: `--auto-deps=up`

```bash
vix run src/server.cpp --auto-deps=up
```

In addition to the script directory, Vix can now search for `.vix/deps` in parent directories.
Useful for nested layouts and running scripts from subfolders.

---

# 🧠 Improvements

- Introduced `AutoDepsMode` (`None`, `Local`, `Up`)
- Proper validation and error handling for invalid `--auto-deps` values
- Improved `vix run --help` documentation
- Cleaner separation between runtime args (`--args`) and compiler flags (`--`)


## [v1.36.3] - 2026-02-19

### Improved

#### CLI – `vix publish`

- Generate a **rich registry entry** when publishing a new package:
  - Adds structured `api` metadata (`format`, `generatedBy`, `updatedAt`)
  - Includes `constraints`, `dependencies`, `exports`, `maintainers`, and `quality`
  - Derives defaults from `vix.json` when available
- Automatically refreshes `api.updatedAt` on every publish
- Keeps backward compatibility with existing registry entries
- Ensures `versions` is always a valid object before insertion

### Why this matters

Registry entries are now:
- More consistent
- Self-describing
- Future-proof for tooling and validation
- Closer to production-grade metadata from first publish

## v1.36.2

### Fix

- **publish**: always include published version (`tag` + `commit`) inside registry entry `versions` field

### Why

Registry validation requires a non-empty `versions` object.

Previously, `vix publish` created a registry entry with:

```json
{
  "versions": {}
}
```

This caused the `validate_registry_pr` workflow to fail before auto-merge.

### Result

- Registry PRs are now immediately valid
- Auto-merge works reliably without manual intervention
- No need to manually patch `index/*.json`
- `registry_index_from_tags` remains compatible

### Impact

Publishing a new library version is now fully automated and stable.
## v1.36.1

### Improvements

- CLI: improve `vix publish` messaging when triggering registry index updates
- Better feedback after tag push and registry workflow trigger
- Clearer output when version is already registered

### Registry

- Confirmed fully automatic tag-driven registry workflow
- Auto PR creation + auto-merge stabilized using bot token

### Internal

- Minor CLI output refinements
- No breaking changes
## v1.36.0

### ✨ Added

- `vix unpublish` command
  Allows package owners to remove an existing registry entry in a controlled way.
- Full CLI integration for unpublish flow (dispatch + command wiring).
- Tag-driven registry compatibility (CLI aligned with automated `index_from_tags` workflow).

### 🔄 Improved

- Registry sync stability (`vix registry sync`) with stricter reset and checkout handling.
- Publish / remove flows aligned with Git tag–based version indexing.
- CLI registry commands hardened for consistency with automated GitHub Actions pipeline.

### 🛠 Internal

- Registry index now derives owner/repo from `repo.url` instead of namespace.
- Improved compatibility with automated registry version generation from Git tags.
- CLI prepared for fully automated registry maintenance workflow.

---

This release strengthens the reliability of the Vix Registry and completes the tag-driven publication lifecycle.
## v1.35.3

### Changed

- **CLI (new)** : Generate modern `vix.json` for header-only libraries.
- Replace deprecated `repo` field with `repository`.
- Set `type` to `"header-only"` for `--lib` template.
- Add `include`, `keywords`, and `authors` fields to generated manifest.

### Notes

This is a patch release improving CLI scaffolding consistency with the Vix Registry specification.
No runtime behavior changes.

## v1.35.2

### Fixed
- CLI (Doctor): Fix MSVC build failure (`which_vix` not declared on Windows).
- Removed duplicate `<vix/utils/Env.hpp>` include.
- Added missing `<cstdio>` include for `_popen` / `popen` usage.
- Minor MSVC compatibility adjustments.

### Notes
This is a patch release focused on Windows/MSVC build stability.
No runtime behavior changes.

## [v1.35.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- Silenced MSVC warnings in CLI module:
  - C4505 (unreferenced static functions removed)
  - C4189 (unused local variable)
- Scoped Unix-only helpers under `#ifndef _WIN32` to avoid Windows-only compilation warnings.
- Removed deprecated `std::getenv` usage in CLI commands in favor of `vix::utils::vix_getenv` (MSVC C4996 clean).

### Improved
- Cleaner cross-platform compilation (Windows + Linux/macOS).
- More deterministic Windows builds (no internal linkage noise).
- Safer environment variable handling in `doctor`, `upgrade`, and `uninstall`.

### Internal
- Minor CLI refactoring to ensure functions are only compiled where used.
- No behavioral changes.

# v1.35.0

## CLI --- Install Lifecycle & Environment Diagnostics

This release introduces a complete install lifecycle for the Vix CLI,
including environment diagnostics, secure upgrades, uninstall logic, and
install metadata tracking.

## ✨ New

### `vix doctor`

Environment and install health checker.

-   Detects OS and architecture
-   Detects current binary location
-   Reads `install.json` metadata
-   Checks PATH consistency
-   Verifies required tools (curl/wget, tar, sha256, etc.)
-   Optional GitHub latest release check (`--online`)
-   JSON output mode (`--json`)
-   Proper exit codes for CI usage

Example:

``` bash
vix doctor
vix doctor --online
vix doctor --json --online
```

### `vix upgrade`

Secure binary upgrade mechanism.

-   Resolves latest tag from GitHub
-   Verifies sha256
-   Verifies minisign (when available)
-   Atomic install (tmp + move)
-   Writes structured `install.json` metadata
-   Preserves install directory

Example:

``` bash
vix upgrade
```

### `vix uninstall`

Robust uninstall command.

-   Removes current binary
-   Supports `--all` to remove all detected binaries in PATH
-   Supports `--purge` to delete local store/cache
-   Gracefully handles permission errors
-   Provides sudo hint when required
-   Post-check detects remaining binaries in PATH

Example:

``` bash
vix uninstall
vix uninstall --all --purge
```

## 🔐 Install Metadata (`install.json`)

Upgrades now generate structured metadata:

``` json
{
  "repo": "vixcpp/vix",
  "version": "v1.35.0",
  "installed_version": "v1.35.0",
  "installed_at": "...",
  "os": "linux",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "install_dir": "...",
  "download_bytes": 0,
  "asset_url": "..."
}
```

This enables:

-   Reliable diagnostics (`doctor`)
-   PATH validation
-   Upgrade comparison
-   Future telemetry-safe tooling

## 🎯 Help Output Improvements

The CLI help output is now structured and linked:

-   Section-based layout
-   Quick start block
-   Install lifecycle commands surfaced
-   Documentation links included
-   Registry link added

Improves discoverability and developer experience.

## Stability

This release does not modify runtime modules.\
Changes are isolated to the CLI module.

Vix.cpp continues to move toward a fully self-managed, production-grade
runtime.

## v1.22.0 — Runtime Console & DX Stabilization

**Release focus:** developer experience, runtime safety, and clear separation between dev console and production logging.

---

## ✨ New

## Vix Console (core)

Introduces a Node.js–inspired, **zero-config runtime console** available directly via:

```cpp
#include <vix/console.hpp>

vix::console.log("Hello");
```

Designed for **developer-facing output** with **strict runtime guarantees**.

---

## 🧠 Design & Runtime Guarantees

## Zero configuration by default

- Console works immediately after `#include`
- No init calls
- No setup required

## Safe defaults

- Default level: `info`
- `debug` **OFF** by default
- `log == info`
- `warn` / `error` → `stderr`
- `log` / `info` / `debug` → `stdout`

## Performance contract

- If a level is filtered, the call is **near-zero cost**
  - No message construction
  - No allocation
  - No lock
  - No I/O

## Thread-safe, atomic output

- Each console call emits a **single atomic line**

## Stable environment configuration

- Supports:
  - `VIX_CONSOLE_LEVEL`
  - `NO_COLOR`
  - `VIX_COLOR`
- Environment is read **once** (startup / first use)
- Behavior is fixed afterward

## Minimal anti-spam protection

- Prevents accidental performance collapse from excessive `log` / `info` usage
- `warn` and `error` are **never suppressed**

---

## 📖 Documentation

## New documentation: Vix Console

- Clearly defines:
  - Scope
  - Guarantees
  - Constraints
  - Non-goals

## Explicit separation

- `vix::console` → runtime / developer output
- `vix::utils::Logger` → production logging, structured output

## Clarified non-goals

- No `console.table`
- No `console.group`
- No `console.time`
- No `console.count`

Advanced debugging and observability belong to `vix::utils::Logger`.

---

## 🔒 Philosophy Clarification

- Vix Console is **intentionally not a production logger**
- Borrows **Node.js developer trust**
- Enforces **C++ runtime discipline**
- Designed to be safe **even if developers do not read documentation**

---

## 🔗 Commits

- `docs(core): document Vix Console contract and integrate core console module`
- `docs(console): clarify scope, non-goals, and logger separation`


## v1.21.1
- chore(cli): bump CLI submodule to v1.19.12 (cleaner sanitizer output, unified timeout logic, refined code frames)
- docs/examples: add `examples/vix_routes_showcase.cpp` (HTTP routes + query params showcase)

# Vix.cpp v1.21.0

This release stabilizes the new DB core module, improves CLI runtime output, and fixes several build/link issues across modules.

## Highlights
- DB/ORM separation is now fully aligned: `vix::db` is the low-level core layer, `vix::orm` remains optional sugar on top.
- CLI runtime output and error UX were refined to be clearer and less noisy.
- Improved reliability for MySQL detection/linking in diverse environments.

## CLI (modules/cli)
- Fix: prevent duplicate runtime logs in some failure paths.
- Improve: runtime error detectors and diagnostics formatting.
- Improve: UX cleanup for run/dev flows (clearer output, less noise).

## DB Core (modules/db)
- Fix: CMake/source/linkage issues across DB drivers.
- Fix: MySQL Connector/C++ discovery via fallback alias target (more robust CI/local setups).
- Improve: driver linkage consistency and feature flag reporting.

## Umbrella / Modules
- Introduced `vix::db` as a core module and decoupled ORM tooling/drivers accordingly.
- Synced submodules after DB/ORM compatibility fixes.

## Upgrade notes
- If you enable `ORM`, it automatically implies `DB`.
- If MySQL is enabled, ensure Connector/C++ is available (the fallback alias helps when CMake configs are missing).

## v1.20.1 — Improved CLI Error UX & Build Feedback

### ✨ CLI — Error reporting & diagnostics
- Introduce **Python-like compiler error rendering** with code frames
  `(file:line:column + surrounding context)`
- Highlight **only the faulty line** with a red caret (`^`) for instant readability
- Safely truncate very long lines with **UTF-8–aware ellipsis**
- Add **precise, Vix-style hints** for common mistakes
  (e.g. `Response::json()` misuse)
- Hide verbose alternative diagnostics unless log level is `debug` or `trace`
- Improve `run` / script error reporting for clearer, actionable diagnostics

### 🔨 CLI — Build output & Ninja integration
- Restore **live Ninja progress output** (`[x/y %]`) during builds
- Filter noisy compiler command output in live mode
- Keep **full raw build logs** in `build.log` for post-mortem diagnostics
- Let `ErrorHandler` display **structured, human-readable errors** on failure

### ✅ Notes

This release focuses on **runtime performance**, **log scalability**, and **CLI robustness**, especially under high load and iterative development workflows.

## v1.17.4 — 2026-01-02

### 🔧 Fixed

- **CMake / Packaging**

  - Fixed `find_package(Vix)` failures caused by missing `Boost::filesystem` / `Boost::system` targets.
  - Ensured all required dependencies are resolved **before** loading `VixTargets.cmake`.
  - Removed deprecated `FindBoost` behavior in exported configs (CMP0167-safe).
  - Stabilized consumer builds on macOS (AppleClang + Homebrew Boost) and Linux.

- **Core**

  - Removed `Boost::filesystem` from `vix::core` public link interface.
  - Restricted Boost dependency to `Boost::system` only (Asio / Beast).
  - Updated HTTP server internals and headers accordingly.

- Disabled execution of CLI commands and flags inside the REPL
- Removed CLI flags from REPL autocompletion to avoid misleading suggestions
- Disabled `help <command>` and CLI command listing inside the REPL
- Improved REPL UX consistency with a sandboxed, Bun/Deno-like experience

### 🧠 Behavior Changes

- The REPL is now a **pure interactive sandbox** for:
  - math expressions
  - variables
  - JSON literals
  - `print / println`
  - `Vix` API (`cd`, `cwd`, `env`, `args`, `exit`, etc.)
- All project-related CLI commands must now be executed **outside** the REPL

### 🛠 Internal

- Removed remaining runtime dependencies between the REPL and the CLI dispatcher
- Simplified REPL command completion logic

---

## 1.16.0 — 2025-01-XX

### 🚀 Highlights

- **REPL is now the default mode**
  Running `vix` starts the interactive shell automatically
  (no more `vix repl`).

- **Modern runtime experience**
