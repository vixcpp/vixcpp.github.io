# vix replay

`vix replay` replays a previously recorded Vix execution.

It helps you reproduce a run that failed, crashed, or behaved unexpectedly. Use it when you want to rerun the same command without guessing what happened.

> `vix run` does not record replay data by default.
> To create a replay record, run your command with `--replay`.

## Usage

```bash
vix replay [id|last|failed] [options] [-- app-args...]
```

## What it does

`vix replay` loads a recorded execution from `.vix/runs/` and runs it again with the stored context.

It can:

- replay the latest recorded run
- replay the latest failed run
- replay a specific run by id
- show recorded run details
- list previous runs
- clean recorded replay data
- append extra runtime arguments
- add temporary environment variables during replay

## Recording a run

Replay records are created only when `vix run` is executed with `--replay`.

```bash
# Record a project run
vix run api --replay

# Record a built executable run
vix run ./build-ninja/api --replay

# Record a manifest run
vix run app.vix --replay

# Record a single-file C++ run
vix run main.cpp --replay
```

Without `--replay`, `vix run` runs normally and does not create `.vix/runs/`.

```bash
vix run api
vix run main.cpp
```

These commands do not create replay data.

## Basic usage

```bash
# Replay the latest recorded run
vix replay

# Replay the latest run explicitly
vix replay last

# Replay the latest failed run
vix replay failed

# Replay a specific run
vix replay 2026-05-05-18-42-11-a91f
```

## When to use it

Use `vix replay` when an execution fails and you want to reproduce it quickly.

Typical workflow:

```bash
vix run api --replay
# something fails

vix replay failed
```

Or:

```bash
vix run server.cpp --replay
# unexpected result

vix replay last
```

## Why it matters

Without replay, you often need to remember: which command was used, which directory it ran from, which arguments were passed, which environment variables were active, which output was produced, and whether the run failed, crashed, or was interrupted.

`vix replay` keeps that context in a recorded run.

## Difference between vix run, vix dev, and vix replay

| Command      | Best for                   | Records/replays context                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `vix run`    | manual run                 | records only with `--replay`                |
| `vix dev`    | active development         | records development executions when enabled |
| `vix replay` | reproducing a previous run | replays recorded execution                  |

`vix replay` does not replace `vix run` or `vix dev`. It uses recorded executions created by replay-enabled runs.

## Replay the latest run

```bash
vix replay
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
vix replay last
```

You can also use:

```bash
vix replay latest
```

## Replay the latest failed run

```bash
vix replay failed
```

You can also use:

```bash
vix replay fail
```

This is useful when several successful runs happened before or after a failure.

## Replay a specific run

Each recorded run has an id:

```bash
vix replay 2026-05-05-18-42-11-a91f
```

Run ids are stored under `.vix/runs/`.

## List recorded runs

```bash
vix replay list

# Show only failed runs
vix replay list --failed

# Show only successful runs
vix replay list --success

# Show only interrupted runs
vix replay list --interrupted

# Limit the number of results
vix replay list --limit 10
```

## Show a recorded run

```bash
# Show the latest run
vix replay show last

# Show the latest failed run
vix replay show failed

# Show a specific run
vix replay show 2026-05-05-18-42-11-a91f
```

This prints the recorded metadata, command, status, duration, logs, and replay hint.

## Dry run

Use `--dry-run` to print the replay command without executing it:

```bash
vix replay last --dry-run
```

Useful when you want to inspect what will be replayed before running it.

## Pass extra app arguments

Arguments after `--` are appended to the replay command:

```bash
vix replay last -- --port 8080
```

## Add environment variables

```bash
vix replay last --env VIX_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Multiple variables:

```bash
vix replay last --env VIX_LOG_LEVEL=debug --env APP_ENV=local
```

## Use another replay directory

By default, `vix replay` reads from `.vix/runs/` in the current directory.

Use `--dir` or `--cwd` to read from another location:

```bash
vix replay last --dir ./api
vix replay list --cwd ./api
```

## Clean replay data

```bash
vix replay clean
```

Removes recorded replay runs from `.vix/runs/`.

## Recorded files

A recorded run is stored as:

```
.vix/runs/<id>/
  run.json
  stdout.log
  stderr.log
  combined.log
```

The latest marker stores the most recent run id:

```
.vix/runs/latest
```

## Common workflows

```bash
# Record and replay a project run
vix run api --replay
vix replay last

# Record and replay a single-file C++ run
vix run main.cpp --replay
vix replay last

# Replay the latest failed run
vix replay failed

# Inspect the latest run before replaying
vix replay show last
vix replay last

# List failures
vix replay list --failed

# Replay with debug logs
vix replay failed --env VIX_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Print the replay command only
vix replay last --dry-run

# Clean old replay data
vix replay clean
```

## Common mistakes

### Expecting vix run to record automatically

Wrong:

```bash
vix run api
vix replay last
```

Correct:

```bash
vix run api --replay
vix replay last
```

`vix run` does not create replay records by default. Use `--replay` when you want the execution to be recorded.

### Running replay from the wrong directory

Wrong:

```bash
cd ..
vix replay last
```

Correct:

```bash
cd api
vix replay last
```

Or:

```bash
vix replay last --dir ./api
```

`vix replay` reads `.vix/runs/` from the current directory unless `--dir` or `--cwd` is provided.

### Forgetting that failed means the latest failed run

```bash
vix replay failed
```

This does not replay every failed run. It replays only the latest failed run.

To list all failures:

```bash
vix replay list --failed
```

### Passing extra arguments without --

Wrong:

```bash
vix replay last --port 8080
```

Correct:

```bash
vix replay last -- --port 8080
```

The `--` separates replay options from arguments appended to the replayed command.
